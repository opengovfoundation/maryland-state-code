Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common.

<text>A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (i) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (ii) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions established under this subsection may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary&rsquo;s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary&rsquo;s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for &ldquo;lineal descendants per stirpes&rdquo;. This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary&rsquo;s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary&rsquo;s domicile at the owner&rsquo;s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate.
