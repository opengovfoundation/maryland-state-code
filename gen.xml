<text>The General Assembly determines and finds that lands and waters comprising the watersheds of the State are great natural assets and resources. As a result of erosion and sediment deposit on lands and in waters within the watersheds of the State, these waters are being polluted and despoiled to such a degree that fish, marine life, and recreational use of the waters are being affected adversely. To protect the natural resources of the State, the Secretary of the Environment, in consultation with the Secretary of Natural Resources shall adopt criteria and procedures for the counties and the local soil conservation districts to implement soil erosion control programs. These procedures may provide for departmental review and approval of major grading, sediment, and erosion control plans. These procedures shall provide that the Department of the Environment conduct periodic inspections and review of the implementation by the counties and the local soil conservation districts of these control plans.</text>
<text>Because of the great potential for harm to the waters of the State if soil erosion and sediment control measures are not properly implemented and maintained and because of the cumulative effect on the environment of violations whether the project creating the violations is large or small, it is necessary for the protection of the waters of the State to provide procedures for obtaining immediate compliance with the law, when violations occur.</text>

Also, it is State public policy to provide that no waste is discharged into any waters of this State without first receiving necessary treatment or other corrective action to protect the legitimate beneficial uses of this State&rsquo;s waters, and to provide and promote, through innovative and alternative methods of waste and wastewater treatment, prevention, abatement, and control of new or existing water pollution.

</subsection><subheading1><text>A COMPACT</text></subheading1>
<text>WHEREAS, It is recognized that abatement of existing pollution and the control of future pollution of interstate streams can best be promoted through a joint agency representing the several states located wholly or in part within the area drained by any such interstate stream; and</text>
<text>WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States has given its consent to the states of Maryland and West Virginia, the commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact providing for the creation of a conservancy district to consist of the drainage basin of the Potomac River and the main and tributary streams therein, for &ldquo;the purpose of regulating, controlling, preventing, or otherwise rendering unobjectionable and harmless the pollution of the waters of said Potomac drainage area by sewage and industrial and other wastes&rdquo;; and</text>
<text>WHEREAS, The regulation, control and prevention of pollution is directly affected by the quantities of water in said streams and the uses to which such water may be put, thereby requiring integration and co-ordination of the planning for the development and use of the water and associated land resources through co-operation with, and support and co-ordination of, the activities of federal, state, local and private agencies, groups, and interests concerned with the development, utilization and conservation of the water and associated land resources of the said conservancy district;</text>
<text>NOW THEREFORE, the states of Maryland and West Virginia, the commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia, hereinafter designated signatory bodies, do hereby create the Potomac Valley Conservancy District, hereinafter designated the Conservancy District, comprising all of the area drained by the Potomac River and its tributaries; and also, do hereby create, as an agency of each signatory body, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, hereinafter designated the Commission, under the articles of organization as set forth below.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article I.</text></subheading1>
<text>The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin shall consist of three members from each signatory body and three members appointed by the President of the United States. Said Commissioners, other than those appointed by the President, shall be chosen in a manner and for the terms provided by law of the signatory body from which they are appointed and shall serve without compensation from the Commission but shall be paid by the Commission their actual expenses incurred and incident to the performance of their duties.</text>
<subsection id=":gen::5:3::5-303:a:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(a)</enum>
<text>The Commission shall meet and organize within thirty days after the effective date of this compact, shall elect from its number a chairman and vice-chairman, shall adopt suitable bylaws, shall make, adopt and promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary for its management and control, and shall adopt a seal.</text>
</subsection><subsection id=":gen::5:3::5-303:b:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(b)</enum>
<text>The Commission shall appoint and, at its pleasure, remove or discharge such officers and legal, engineering, clerical, expert and other assistants as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect, and shall determine their qualifications and fix their duties and compensation. Such personnel as may be employed shall be employed without regard to any civil service or other similar requirements for employees of any of the signatory bodies. The Commission may maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the area of the signatory bodies.</text>
</subsection><subsection id=":gen::5:3::5-303:c:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(c)</enum>
<text>The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report thereof and shall in such report set forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact. The Commission, however, shall not incur any obligations for administrative or other expenses prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same nor shall it in any way pledge the credit of any of the signatory bodies. Each of the signatory bodies reserves the right to make at any time an examination and audit of the accounts of the Commission.</text>

</subsection><subsection id=":gen::5:3::5-303:b:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(b)</enum>

</subsection><subsection id=":gen::5:3::5-303:c:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(c)</enum>

<paragraph id=":gen::5:3::5-303:f:1:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(1)</enum>
<text>To make and, if needful from time to time, revise and to recommend to the signatory bodies, reasonable minimum standards for the treatment of sewage and industrial or other wastes now discharged or to be discharged in the future to the streams of the Conservancy District, and also for cleanliness of the various streams in the Conservancy District.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gen::5:3::5-303:f:2:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>To establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory bodies through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in the District in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use, and for this purpose technical experts employed by appropriate state water-pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two or more states. Each signatory body agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the Commission with its recommendations thereon.</text>
<text>The Commission shall review such classification and recommendations and accept or return the same with its comments. In the event of return, the signatory body will consider the comments of the Commission and resubmit the classification proposal, with or without amendment, with any additional comments for further action by the Commission.</text>
<text>It is agreed that after acceptance of such classification, the signatory body through its appropriate state water-pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet or exceed standards established by the Commission for classified waters. The Commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity and in a manner similar to that in which these standards and classifications were originally established.</text>
<text>It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, industrial and agricultural uses, navigation and disposal of wastes.</text>
</paragraph></subsection><subheading1><text>Article III.</text></subheading1>
<text>For the purpose of dealing with the problems of pollution and of water and associated land resources in specific areas which directly affect two or more, but not all, signatory bodies, the Commission may establish sections of the Commission consisting of the Commissioners from such affected signatory bodies, provided, however, that no signatory body may be excluded from any section in which it wishes to participate. The Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States may participate in any section. The Commission shall designate, and from time to time may change, the geographical area with respect to which each section shall function. Each section shall, to such extent as the Commission may from time to time authorize, have authority to exercise and perform with respect to its designated geographical area any power or function vested in the Commission, and in addition may exercise such other powers and perform such functions as may be vested in such section by the laws of any signatory body or by the laws of the United States. The exercise or performance by a section of any power or function vested in the Commission may be financed by the Commission, but the exercise or performance of powers or functions vested solely in a section shall be financed through funds provided in advance by the bodies, including the United States, participating in such section.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article IV.</text></subheading1>
<text>The moneys necessary to finance the Commission in the administration of its business in the Conservancy District shall be provided through appropriations from the signatory bodies and the United States, in the manner prescribed by the laws of the several signatory bodies and of the United States, and in amounts as follows:</text>
<text>The pro rata contribution shall be based on such factors as population, the amount of industrial and domestic pollution; and a flat service charge, as shall be determined from time to time by the Commission, subject, however, to the approval, ratification and appropriation of such contribution by the several signatory bodies.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article V.</text></subheading1>
<text>Pursuant to the aims and purposes of this compact, the signatory bodies mutually agree:</text>

<text>The General Assembly finds that nontidal wetlands play important roles in the preservation and protection of the Chesapeake Bay and other waters of the State. Nontidal wetlands serve important roles through the reduction of pollutant loadings, including excess nutrients, sediment, and toxics, the attenuation of floodwaters and stormwaters, shoreline stabilization and erosion control, waterfowl breeding and habitat for many species of fish, game and nongame birds, and mammals, including rare and endangered species, food chain support, and timber production. Many nontidal wetlands have already been lost or degraded due to the combined effects of population growth and land use. Further degradation and losses of nontidal wetlands will contribute to the decline of the Chesapeake Bay and other waters of the State.</text>

<text>The General Assembly finds and declares that the production and development of oil and gas resources is important to the economic well-being of the State and the nation. The drilling and production of oil and gas should be conducted in a manner that will minimize their effects on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, proper evaluation of a project and the use of the most environmentally sound drilling and production methods are necessary to prevent adverse environmental consequences that would be detrimental to the general welfare, health, safety, and property interests of the citizens of the State. In addition, there are certain circumstances where oil and gas exploration or production should be prohibited, such as when these operations will have a significant adverse effect on the environment. The General Assembly finds that the conduct of exploration or production of oil and gas resources under this subtitle will allow the safe utilization of the State&rsquo;s natural resources and will provide for the protection of the State&rsquo;s environment.</text>
