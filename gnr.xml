<text>The General Assembly finds and declares that the increasing energy requirements of the State and nation continue to exceed domestic sources of energy supply and that demand must be met, at least in the near future, by imported oil. Construction of deepwater ports in waters adjacent to the continental shelf of the United States could accommodate oil tenders too large for present ports and port facilities. As compared to smaller tanker systems, transfer of oil to the United States by these large tankers may have certain advantages, including assured access to the world&rsquo;s total petroleum shipping fleet, a reduction in economic costs and safety hazards, increased transportation efficiency, and reduced environmental hazards to harbors and shorelines. The legislature, in recognition of these objectives and those of protecting the coastal environment, regulating growth and determining land use, and in order to carry out its delegated responsibilities under the federal Deepwater Port Act of 1974, hereby defines the policy and procedure to advance and protect the interests of the people of the State of Maryland in the location, construction and operation of deepwater ports in the waters beyond the State.</text>

<text>For the benefit of the people of the State of Maryland, the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and the improvement of their health and living conditions, it is essential that provision be made for the efficient collection and disposal of waste on a regional basis from both public and private sources in compliance with State and federal laws, regulations, and policies and for the generation of energy and the recovery of useable resources from such waste to the extent practicable. It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist certain participating political subdivisions of this State, other public entities and the private sector of the economy to provide adequate waste disposal facilities (including those which provide for energy generation and resource recovery) and facilities for the generation of steam, electricity, or other forms of energy from fuels which are derived from or are otherwise related to waste disposal facilities by providing a regional coordinating agency and a financing vehicle for such facilities. It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the participating counties to effect waste disposal programs on a regional basis and to that end this subtitle provides for the creation of the Authority. It is the intention and purpose of this subtitle that, without in any way limiting the discretion of the Authority, the Authority and the Maryland Environmental Service cooperate to the maximum extent practicable in effecting a regional waste disposal program in the participating counties.</text>

<text>Forests, timberlands, woodlands, and soil resources of the State are basic assets, and the proper use, development, and preservation of these resources are necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the State. It is the policy of the State to encourage economic management and scientific development of its forests and woodlands to maintain, conserve, and improve the soil resources of the State so that an adequate source of forest products is preserved for the people. Floods and soil erosion must be prevented and the natural beauty of the State preserved. Wildlife must be protected, while the development of recreational interest is encouraged and the fertility and productivity of the soil is maintained. The impairment of reservoirs and dams must be prevented, the tax rate preserved, and the welfare of the people of the State sustained and promoted. Where these interests can be served through cooperative efforts of private forest landowners, with the assistance of the State, it is the policy of the State to encourage, assist, and guide private ownership in the management and fullest economic development of privately owned forest lands. Where these public interests cannot be served and adequately protected under private ownership, it is the policy of the State to acquire control of, and title to these lands as rapidly as the financial resources of the State permit.</text>

<text>The Governor, on behalf of the State, may execute a compact in substantially the following form, with one or more of the states of Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. The General Assembly signifies in advance its approval and ratification of this compact:</text>
</subsection><subheading1><text>Article I</text></subheading1>
<text>The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest fire fighting services by the member states, and by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states of the region and with states which are party to other regional forest fire protection compacts or agreements.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article II</text></subheading1>
<text>This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two or more of the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia and West Virginia which are contiguous have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article III</text></subheading1>
<text>In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that state and shall consult with like officials of the other member states and shall implement cooperation between such states in forest fire prevention and control.</text>
<text>The compact administrators of the member state shall organize to coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.</text>
<text>The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member states.</text>
<text>It shall be the duty of each member state to formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that state and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article IV</text></subheading1>
<text>Whenever the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member state in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it shall be the duty of the state forest fire control agency of that state to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article V</text></subheading1>
<text>Whenever the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of such state shall, under the direction of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the powers of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.</text>
<text>No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.</text>
<text>All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.</text>
<text>Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and maintenance of employees and equipment incurred in connection with such request; provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such services to the receiving member state without charge or cost.</text>
<text>Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.</text>
<text>For the purposes of this compact the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest fire fighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.</text>
<text>The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article VI</text></subheading1>
<text>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to authorize or permit any member state to curtail or diminish its forest fire fighting forces, equipment, services or facilities, and it shall be the duty and responsibility of each member state to maintain adequate forest fire fighting forces and equipment to meet demands for forest fire protection within its borders in the same manner and to the same extent as if this compact were not operative.</text>
<text>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or restrict the powers of any state ratifying the same to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in such prevention, control and extinguishment in such state.</text>
<text>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between the United States Forest Service and a member state or states.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article VII</text></subheading1>
<text>The compact administrators may request the United States Forest Service to act as the primary research and coordinating agency of the Middle Atlantic Interstate Forest Fire Protection Compact in cooperation with the appropriate agencies in each state, and the United States Forest Service may accept the initial responsibility in preparing and presenting to the compact administrators its recommendations with respect to the regional fire plan. Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article VIII</text></subheading1>
<text>The provisions of Article IV and V of this compact which relate to mutual aid in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires shall be operative as between any state party to this compact and any other state which is party to a regional forest fire protection compact in another region; provided, that the legislature of such other state shall have given its assent to such mutual aid provisions of this compact.</text>
<subheading1><text>Article IX</text></subheading1>
<text>This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state ratifying it until the legislature or the Governor of such state takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until six months after notice thereof has been sent by the chief executive of the state desiring to withdraw to the chief executives of all states then parties to the compact.</text>
<subsection id=":gnr::5:8::5-801:b:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(b)</enum>
<text>When the Governor has executed the compact on behalf of the State and caused a verified copy to be filed with the Secretary of State, and when it has been ratified by one or more of the states named in subsection (a) of this section, then the compact becomes operative and effective as between this State and the other state.

<text>Type 1. A primitive area which by its size or location is in effect untouched by urban civilization, and can offer the experience of solitude and self-reliance. Since lands at the higher elevations are important for protection of watersheds, are ecologically vulnerable if unwisely altered by human interference, and may be uneconomic for logging or construction, they may be suitable for this classification.</text>
<text>Type 2. A unit of importance for all the natural sciences, especially ecology, and with outstanding value for education, research, and appreciation of natural processes. Preservation in the desired natural condition is the prevailing purpose of these holdings. Visitation shall be regulated to ensure this preservation on a permanent basis.</text>
<text>Type 3. An area which is not of ecological or primitive stature, but which has the appearance of being in an untouched natural state or is capable of attaining that appearance if held and managed for this purpose.</text>

Any county, city, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and the Department also may purchase or acquire by contract or gift the fee to any property for the purpose of conveying or leasing the property back to its original owner or other person under covenants or other contractual arrangements which limit future use of the property in accordance with the purposes of this section. The county or city may not acquire any fee or any lesser interest in real property for these purposes by purchase or contract requiring a monetary consideration exceeding $500, unless the governing body of the county or city after a public hearing adopts a resolution or formal order declaring the public purpose or use. However, no owner whose property is being used for farming is subject to any condemnation or other land acquisition proceeding for the purposes of this section, by the county, city, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, or the Department, if the owner has granted a scenic easement to the Department, Commission, or political subdivision.</text>

<subsection id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(a)</enum>
<text>The participating states find that:</text>
<paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:1:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(1)</enum>
<text>Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:2:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to the management of those resources;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:3:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(3)</enum>
<text>The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife resources contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic values of a state;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:4:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(4)</enum>
<text>Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration statutes, laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:5:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(5)</enum>
<text>Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:6:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(6)</enum>
<text>The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:7:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(7)</enum>
<text>In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person&rsquo;s home state:</text>

<text>Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure an appearance for a trial at a later date;</text>
</subparagraph><subparagraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:7:ii:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(ii)</enum>
<text>Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</text>

</subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:8:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(8)</enum>
<text>The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if allowed to continue on the person&rsquo;s way after receiving the citation, could return to the person&rsquo;s home state and disregard any duty under the terms of the citation;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:9:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(9)</enum>
<text>In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person&rsquo;s home state is allowed to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on the person&rsquo;s way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:10:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(10)</enum>
<text>The practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gnr::10:12::10-1201:a:11:" role="item" db-date="20060801"><enum>(11)</enum>
<text>The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subsection consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.</text>

<text>Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and</text>
