The proceeds of sale of the notes, after payment from the proceeds of the expenses of the issuance of the notes, shall be expended only on the public purposes for which the bonds are authorized. Twelve months&rsquo; interest on the notes, or any renewal thereof, may be paid from the proceeds, or from the proceeds of the sale of the bonds, accounting from the initial date of issue thereof.

The resolution or ordinance may provide for the issuance of the notes, pursuant to the sale, in series as funds are required, and may also provide for the renewal of the notes at maturity with or without resale. All such notes shall be signed, endorsed, or guaranteed in the same manner as shall be provided by law for the bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued, and no such notes shall be issued under this subsection unless so signed, endorsed, or guaranteed.

Grant anticipation notes authorized by this section may be issued as notes in the nature of commercial paper, and, if so issued, may, in the discretion of the public body or municipality issuing the notes, be secured by a trust indenture with a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State, and by a letter of credit, line of credit or other credit arrangement from or with a bank or other lending institution.
