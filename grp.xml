The District Court shall issue its summons, directed to any constable or sheriff of the county entitled to serve process, and ordering him to notify by first-class mail the tenant, assignee, or subtenant to appear before the District Court at the trial to be held on the fifth day after the filing of the complaint, to answer the park owner&rsquo;s complaint to show cause why the prayer of the park owner should not be granted, and the constable or sheriff shall proceed to serve the summons upon the resident, assignee, or subtenant in the property or upon his known or authorized agent, but if for any reason, neither the resident, assignee, or subtenant, nor his agent, can be found, then the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously upon the mobile home.

<text>If the applicable time-share instrument so provides, a person who has a duty to make assessments for time-share expenses has a lien on a time-share for any assessment levied against that time-share or fines imposed against its owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due, effective upon recording.</text>

<text>As to a time-share estate, assessments, interest, late charges, costs of collection, and reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees may be enforced by the imposition of a lien under the Maryland Contract Lien Act. Liens may be enforced and foreclosed in a separate proceeding against an individual time-share estate or enforced and foreclosed in a single proceeding against some or all time-share estates in the same project whose owners are in arrears in payment of assessments. Enforcement and foreclosure of a number of liens under a single proceeding does not alter the individual rights of an owner, including the right to receive any surplus from the sale that the owner would be entitled to receive under a separate proceeding against an individual time-share estate, or the rights of the person enforcing the liens. Suit for any deficiency following foreclosure may be maintained in the same proceeding, and suit for any money judgment for unpaid assessments may also be maintained in the same proceeding without waiving the right to seek a lien under the Maryland Contract Lien Act.</text>

<text>As to a time-share license, the person who has the duty to make assessments shall have the rights of a secured party under &sect; 9-504 of the Commercial Law Article to sell, lease, or dispose of the time-share license.

<text>If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment becomes due provided that within 15 days of an owner&rsquo;s failure to pay an installment, that person who has a duty to make assessments notifies the owner that, if the owner fails to pay any installment within 15 days of the notice, full payment of the remaining annual assessment will then be due and shall constitute a lien on the unit as provided in this section.</text>
</subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id=":grp::11A:::11A-110:e:2:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>The lien is perfected upon recordation of a claim of lien, with respect to the time-share estate, among the land records of the county in which the time-share unit is situate, or with respect to the time-share license, among the financing records in the county in which the time-share unit is situated. The claim of lien shall state the description of the time-share unit, the name of the record owner, the amount due, and the period for which the assessment was due. The claim of lien shall also state that notice of intent to perfect the lien, giving the time-share owner an opportunity to dispute the amount of the assessment, was sent to the last known address of the owner not less than 10 days prior to recordation. The claim of lien shall be signed and verified by an officer or agent of the association. On full payment of the assessment and other permitted amounts for which the lien is claimed, the unit owner shall be entitled to a recordable satisfaction of the lien in any form used for the release of mortgages in the county in which the condominium is located. Fees and charges imposed under this section are enforceable as assessments under this section.</text>
