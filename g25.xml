<paragraph id=":g25::1:::11D:a:1:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(1)</enum>
<text>The following legislative findings are made.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":g25::1:::11D:a:2:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>As a result of the continuing increases in the cost of construction or rehabilitation, county taxes, heating and electricity expenses, maintenance and repair expenses, inflation, the cost of land, the cost of energy conservation measures, and the levels of borrowing costs, including interest, persons and families in many areas within Cecil County, including areas which contain presently stable neighborhoods and middle class residential housing, are unable to purchase, rehabilitate, and maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing which provides an opportunity for home ownership either directly or through a condominium or cooperative form of ownership. The inability of families to purchase and hold housing in the county results in the decline of new housing and in the decay of existing housing and of existing neighborhoods with attendant increases in costs for welfare, police, and fire protection. The decline in new housing construction, together with the decay of existing housing, has produced a critical shortage of adequate housing in the county, adversely affecting the economy of the county and the well-being of its residents. Private enterprise without the assistance of the residential mortgage program contemplated by this section cannot achieve the construction or rehabilitation of adequate housing for persons and families of Cecil County. The alternative of forcing families to live in substandard housing is undesirable since it tends to decrease the interest of families in their communities, the maintenance of their property, and the preservation of their neighborhoods. The county has a basic public interest in providing a supplemental source of single-family residential mortgage funds at a cost lower to the borrower than otherwise prevailing for residential mortgages and a basic interest in stimulating a steady flow of funds for residential housing in order to assist in maintaining a well-balanced society, maintaining existing housing, preserving established neighborhoods, and maintaining a sound tax base.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":g25::1:::11D:a:3:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(3)</enum>
<text>A large number of county residents have been and will be subject to hardship in finding decent, safe, and sanitary housing unless new facilities are constructed and existing housing, where appropriate, is rehabilitated. Unless the supply of housing and the ability of persons and families to obtain mortgage financing is increased significantly and expeditiously, a large number of residents of Cecil County may be compelled to live in unsanitary, overcrowded, or unsafe conditions to the detriment of the health, welfare, and well-being of these persons and of the whole community of which they are a part. By increasing the housing supply of the county and the ability of persons and families to obtain mortgage financing, the clearance, replanning, development and redevelopment of blighted areas will be aided, the critical shortage of adequate housing will be ameliorated, and the ability to preserve and utilize existing housing and neighborhoods will be greatly enhanced.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":g25::1:::11D:a:4:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(4)</enum>
<text>A major cause of this housing crisis is the lack of funds at borrowing costs which are at a level whereby persons and families can afford to own and maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing. An additional major cause of a housing crisis is the lack of funds available to finance housing by the private mortgage lending institutions of the State. This lack of funds has frustrated the maintenance, sale, and purchase of existing residences in Cecil County.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":g25::1:::11D:a:5:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(5)</enum>
<text>The authority and powers conferred under this section and the expenditure of public moneys necessary and appropriate to carry out a residential mortgage program as contemplated in this section, constitute the serving of a valid public purpose. The enactment of this section is declared to be in the public interest.</text>
</paragraph></subsection><subsection id=":g25::1:::11D:b:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(b)</enum>
<text>It is the declared legislative purpose to aid in remedying these conditions, and to promote the expansion of the supply of funds at lower borrowing costs than those otherwise prevailing for residential mortgages for persons and families, and thereby help alleviate the shortage of adequate housing and preserve existing housing and neighborhoods.</text>

The course and distance of each ditch shall be carefully noted and sufficient notes made, so that it may be accurately platted and mapped.

Frequent bench marks shall be established along the line, on permanent objects, and their elevation and full description recorded in the field books and their location shown on the map. If it is deemed expedient by the engineer and viewers, other levels may be run to determine the fall from one part of the district to another. If an old watercourse, ditch or channel is being widened, deepened or straightened, it shall be accurately cross-sectioned, so as to compute the amount of cubic yards saved by the use of such old channel. A drainage map of the district shall then be completed, showing the location of the ditch or ditches and other improvements, and the boundary, as closely as may be determined by the records, of the lands owned by such individual landowner within the district. The location of any railroads or public highways and the boundary of any incorporated towns or villages within the district shall be shown on the map.

The total number of acres of each class in the entire district shall be ascertained and presented in tabulated form. The scale of assessment upon the several classes of land returned by the engineer and viewers shall be in the ratio of five, four, three, two and one; that is to say, as often as five mills per acre is assessed against the land in &ldquo;Class A&rdquo;, four mills per acre shall be assessed against the land in &ldquo;Class B&rdquo;, three mills per acre in &ldquo;Class C&rdquo;, two mills per acre in &ldquo;Class D&rdquo;, and one mill per acre in &ldquo;Class E&rdquo;.
