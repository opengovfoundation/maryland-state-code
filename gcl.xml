<text>Subject to &sect;&sect; 4A-211(e) and 4A-405(d) and (e) of this title, if a beneficiary&rsquo;s bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.</text>

<text>If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date.

Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.</text>

<text>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a warehouse&rsquo;s lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.

The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.</text>

<text>It is the policy of the State of Maryland to oppose restraints of trade and unfair trade practices in the form of foreign discriminatory boycotts not specifically authorized by the law of the United States which are fostered or imposed by foreign persons, foreign governments or international organizations against any domestic individual on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex or national origin. It is also the policy of the State of Maryland to oppose those actions, including the formation of agreements, understandings or contractual arrangements, expressed or implied, which have the effect of furthering or supporting these discriminatory boycotts, in order that the peace, health, safety, prosperity and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured. It is the further policy of the State of Maryland not to impede domestic or foreign commerce, the free flow of goods in commerce, or actions reasonably necessary to protect goods moving in commerce. The State of Maryland recognizes the right of Maryland firms to decide whether to enter into commercial agreements with foreign firms, provided the agreement does not contravene U.S. foreign policy or any federal or Maryland laws and the agreement does not discriminate against domestic individuals entitled to the benefit of the laws of Maryland on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex or national origin, and the right of Maryland firms to decide whether to enter into a commercial agreement with a foreign firm that would advance the political and economic interests of a foreign country provided that agreement does not contravene U.S. foreign policy or federal or Maryland laws and does not discriminate against domestic individuals entitled to the benefits of the laws of Maryland on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin. This subtitle shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the State of Maryland for the protection of the people of this State, and shall be administered and principally enforced by the Attorney General of the State of Maryland. The provisions of this subtitle shall be construed liberally so as to effectuate this declaration of policy and the laws and Constitution of the United States, but nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to infringe upon the right of the United States government to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</text>

<paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:a:1:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(1)</enum>
<text>The General Assembly of Maryland finds that consumer protection is one of the major issues which confront all levels of government, and that there has been mounting concern over the increase of deceptive practices in connection with sales of merchandise, real property, and services and the extension of credit.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:a:2:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>The General Assembly recognizes that there are federal and State laws which offer protection in these areas, especially insofar as consumer credit practices are concerned, but it finds that existing laws are inadequate, poorly coordinated and not widely known or adequately enforced.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:a:3:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(3)</enum>
<text>The General Assembly of Maryland also finds, as a result of public hearings in some of the metropolitan counties during the 1973 interim, that improved enforcement procedures are necessary to help alleviate the growing problem of deceptive consumer practices and urges that favorable consideration be given to requests for increased budget allocation for increases in staff and other measures tending to improve the enforcement capabilities or increase the authority of the Division.</text>

<paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:b:1:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(1)</enum>
<text>It is the intention of this legislation to set certain minimum statewide standards for the protection of consumers across the State, and the General Assembly strongly urges that local subdivisions which have created consumer protection agencies at the local level encourage the function of these agencies at least to the minimum level set forth in the standards of this title.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:b:2:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(2)</enum>
<text>The General Assembly is concerned that public confidence in merchants offering goods, services, realty, and credit is being undermined, although the majority of business people operate with integrity and sincere regard for the consumer.</text>
</paragraph><paragraph id=":gcl::13:1::13-102:b:3:" db-date="20060801"><enum>(3)</enum>
<text>The General Assembly concludes, therefore, that it should take strong protective and preventive steps to investigate unlawful consumer practices, to assist the public in obtaining relief from these practices, and to prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland. It is the purpose of this title to accomplish these ends and thereby maintain the health and welfare of the citizens of the State.</text>

<text>Damages or expenses that relate to events after the date of entry of judgment must be reduced to their present value as of that date. In this subsection, &ldquo;present value&rdquo; means the amount, as of a date certain, of one or more sums payable in the future or the value of one or more performances due in the future, discounted to the date certain. The discount is determined by the interest rate specified by the parties in their agreement unless that rate was manifestly unreasonable when the agreement was entered into. Otherwise, the discount is determined by a commercially reasonable rate that takes into account the circumstances of each case when the agreement was entered into.</text>
