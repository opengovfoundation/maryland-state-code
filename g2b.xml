For the purpose of this subsection &ldquo;owners of real or leasehold property&rdquo; includes holders of leasehold improvements upon ground rents, the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland but excludes the owner of the subject premises. For the purpose of this subsection, a tenant is a person who rents a single&ndash;family dwelling and is residing there for at least one year immediately preceding the hearing of the Board. Should any owner of the dwelling participate as a protestant or proponent of the application, then the owner(s) and the tenant of the dwelling shall each have one&ndash;half vote.

<text>It is the declared policy of the State of Maryland that it is necessary to regulate and control the agreements, franchises and relationships between manufacturers of beer and their distributors for the purpose of fostering and promoting temperance in the consumption thereof, and to promote respect for and obedience to the laws controlling the distribution and sale of beer. It is necessary to accomplish the declared policy in order to eliminate the undue stimulation of sales of beer in this State by manufacturers inducing, coercing, or attempting to induce or coerce, distributors of beer to do acts detrimental to the orderly and lawful distribution thereof by threatened or actual termination of the manufacturer and distributor relationship, directly or indirectly, by the establishment of dual distributors of a brand or brands thereof in a territory presently served by a distributor, or by the sale of the same brand or brands in one territory by more than one franchisee. It is the further declared policy of the State of Maryland that temperance and obedience to the laws controlling the distribution and ultimate sale of beer is promoted by legislation encouraging distributors of beer to make investments in their facilities to serve retail licensees by protecting them against the termination of such distributorships, or other acts described herein, without good cause for such termination or other such acts. The General Assembly further recognizes the distinction between the nature of the distribution of beer and other alcoholic beverages in that distributors of alcoholic liquors other than beer are franchised by manufacturers to distribute many brands of various kinds of alcoholic beverages and are not as vulnerable to the economic pressures of the manufacturers as are beer distributors, which traditionally handle mainly one, two or three brands of beer in their distributorships.</text>
